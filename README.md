# Github as a Growth Monitor

As part of my Insight Project, I built a data pipeline to monitor Github code eco-system and detect projects depending on vulnerable packages. It could be used by DevOps or SRE team to get when dependent packages have security vulnerability.

## Introduction

Git-Monitor is a POC platform to enable organizations to leverage GitHub sort data and track internal package versions along with their dependencies.
